# Sensor-Fusion-Webcam
This Python script uses OpenCV to detect motion and measure illumination levels from a webcam feed. It overlays real-time feedback on the video stream, indicating whether motion is detected and the current brightness state.

### Features
- Motion detect using frame differentiation
- Brightness classification
- Real-time overlay on video feed
- Adjustable thresholds for tunning sensisity

### Requirements
- Python 3 and beyond
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
